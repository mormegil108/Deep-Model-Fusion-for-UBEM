# Deep-Model-Fusion-for-UBEM
This study introduces a hybrid statistical UBEM that integrates dynamic and statistical models to capture building energy consumption patterns. The model incorporates building characteristics, local weather data, and thermal interactions between buildings. The methodology involves the following steps: (1) A dynamic UBEM generates synthetic building energy consumption data at hourly resolution. (2) A hybrid statistical model is developed using the early fusion technique over a time-series model for the time-dependent features and a feed-forward model for the static and thermal interaction features. (3) Finally, the hybrid statistical model assesses retrofit scenarios. Once applied to a sample district in Istanbul, the hybrid model predicts hourly building energy consumption with around 4% MAPE and identifies retrofitting measures that can achieve up to 13% energy savings. The proposed hybrid model offers valuable insights for urban planners in identifying high-demand areas and implementing energy-efficient interventions on urban building stocks.
